# Project: Airline Revenue Management using Markov Decision Process

This is a project for the UBC course Decision Analysis under Uncertainty. The goal of this project is to help a theoretical airline company to decide number of tickets it should sell in order to maximize profits. Concepts of markov decision making process is applied in this project.

### Introduction:
Consider the airline company is operating a flight with 100 seats available, and it's 15 days until flight depature. Days until Flight Departure, Price, Demand mean are given in the Excel file (Solution Output.xlsx). In addition, actual demand is either the mean, one less, or one more, each with 1/3 probability.
